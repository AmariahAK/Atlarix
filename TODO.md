# Atlarix TODO

## v3.5 (done)

- [x] **Prompt suggestor** — Context-aware suggestions via `<suggestions>` block in AI response; parse and strip in backend; show chips in ChatInput.
- [x] **GitHub Actions** — Forge `APPLE_IDENTITY` for macOS signing; certificate import step; Windows build disabled (`if: false`); VirusTotal job after Mac build; publish without Windows.
- [x] **Streaming / tool UX** — Persistent "Working…" tool indicator; `chat:tool:start` / `chat:tool:end` IPC; ToolIndicator component; clear on response end.
- [x] **Atlarix loading animation** — Dedicated `AtlarixAnimation` component (size xs/sm/md/lg/full, phase thinking/done); used in ChatMessage (streaming) and ToolIndicator.
- [x] **Hide Windows** — Website: Windows download hidden, "in development" placeholder; releases: Windows build disabled; atlarix-releases README note.

## Later

- [ ] Re-enable Windows build in CI when EV/OV code signing is ready.
- [ ] Optional: stream terminal output into tool indicator for long-running commands.
- [ ] Optional: brief "done" phase of Atlarix animation when response completes.
